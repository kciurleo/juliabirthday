            This one was maybe not as hard as some of the others (or maybe I fucked
            up the code somewhere and it Was who knows at this point) but either way I'm so happy 
            to be able to once again frustrate you with birthday cards &lt3
            <br>
            The past few years have been nuts on a global and personal scale, but no 
            matter what is going on around us, I know that you love me and I hope you 
            always know how much I love you right back. You've been a person of mine 
            since we drew dumb shit together in 5th grade and you will be forever, and 
            I absolutely treasure the way we fit together regardless of the time and space 
            we've been apart.
            <br>
            It takes me a solid few hours every day to realize I'm actually an adult, and now 
            that you're also FINALLY 23, I guess I can call you an adult too! (But really though, 
            getting to see you grow from the person I met into the person you are today is one 
            of the best things I've been able to do in my life. I'm so immensely proud of you, 
            11 year old Katie is immensely proud of you, and I'm pretty sure 11 year old Julia 
            would be immensely proud of you too - and that's not an easy feat to accomplish)
            <br>
            We'll call sometime soon, and whenever I'm within spitting distance of you again, 
            you best believe I will come running in with a hug (and not spit), and wherever I 
            am, you are always welcome to my home!!
            <br>
            Love you a whole lot and sorry for all the comic sans &lt3
